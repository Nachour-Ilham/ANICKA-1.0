# ANICKA 1.0 : A Mini-Project Chatbot
ANICKA is a simple chatbot project that utilizes Natural Language Processing (NLP) to converse with users. This project is written in Python and utilizes the nltk, torch and tkinter libraries.

ANICKA 1.0 was developed by [@chdkha2001](https://github.com/chdkha2001), [@Nachour-Ilham](https://github.com/Nachour-Ilham), and me as a school project in Python.

## Usage
To chat with ANICKA 1.0, simply type in your message and hit enter. ANICKA will respond to your message using pre-built responses stored in the database. You can also train ANICKA to respond to new messages by adding more data to the database.
